# Do No Harm by Design

## Purpose

SMILE is designed to strengthen public health systems while preventing misuse, unintended harm, or adverse impacts on individuals and communities.

## User Access Model

- SMILE is **not a public user-generated content platform**.
- Access is limited to authorised government and institutional users.
- All actions are logged and auditable.

## Risk Mitigation

- Strict role-based permissions prevent unauthorised access.
- Sensitive operations require elevated privileges.
- Data exposure is minimised by design.

## Protection of Vulnerable Groups

- The system does not expose personal data to public users.
- Child-related data is protected through access control and policy enforcement.

## Governance

Operational governance and oversight are conducted by UNDP in collaboration with national authorities to ensure ethical use and compliance with public interest objectives.
