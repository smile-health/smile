## Overview

The Electronic Health Inventory and Logistics Monitoring System (SMILE) is a digital solution designed to strengthen national health 
supply chain systems through improved visibility, accountability, and efficiency. SMILE directly contributes to the achievement of 
the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by supporting equitable access to essential health commodities, improving 
health system resilience, and enabling data-driven decision-making at national and subnational levels.

SMILE was developed and implemented in collaboration with the Indonesian Ministry of Health and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), 
with a strong focus on sustainability, scalability, and public-sector ownership.
