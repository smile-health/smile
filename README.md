## Overview – Introduction to SMILE Health

The Electronic Health Inventory and Logistics Monitoring System (SMILE) was initially developed to support vaccine distribution and logistics for routine immunization programmes in Indonesia. As a digital solution, SMILE streamlines national health logistics systems to ensure the availability and equitable distribution of vaccines and medicines across the country.

The effectiveness of SMILE was clearly demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the system enabled the rapid distribution of hundreds of millions of vaccine doses to regions nationwide, significantly strengthening Indonesia’s response to the health crisis.

Beyond immunization, SMILE has expanded to support additional health programmes. In March 2024, SMILE was piloted for the rabies programme in East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) and subsequently scaled nationwide starting in August 2024. Today, the platform supports multiple health commodities, including those for tuberculosis, HIV, malaria, rabies, and medical waste management.

Currently, SMILE manages more than 800 million vaccine doses and 100 million medicine doses across over 10,000 healthcare facilities in 38 provinces in Indonesia. The system provides end-to-end visibility across the health supply chain, from storage and inventory management to distribution and reporting.

In 2022, an economic impact study demonstrated the significant value generated by SMILE. With an investment of USD 20 million, the system produced an estimated return of nearly USD 60 million, equivalent to 2.77 times the initial investment for the immunization programme alone. SMILE also prevents potential losses due to temperature excursions, estimated at up to USD 32,600 per month per healthcare facility, highlighting the critical role of real-time cold chain monitoring. The study further provides guidance for digital transformation across other health programmes, including financing through local and national budgets.

SMILE delivers the following key capabilities:
- Monitors vaccine and medicine storage temperatures
- Manages vaccine and medicine inventory accurately
- Supports distribution to remote and hard-to-reach areas
- Automatically generates periodic reports
- Records comprehensive storage and logistics data

SMILE has now become a national health logistics management model with a positive impact not only on the health sector but also on the broader economy, improving efficiency, transparency, and accountability across multiple levels of government.

## Purpose of the Platform

![What Is Smile](docs/images/what-is-smile-2.png)
This application’s digital innovation includes a mobile application for cold chain handlers, a web interface 
that receives data from the app, a temperature logger to track vaccine storage temperatures, and a vaccine and 
cold chain manager to ensure that the product and procedures run smoothly. Health officials can use the analytics 
on the SMILE web interface to verify whether vaccinations are overstocked, falling short of the prescribed amounts,
or entirely out of stock. This facilitates governance and program management by making data available from even 
the most remote sites.

SMILE enhances operational efficiencies, lowers costs for government health providers, and addresses disparities 
in vaccine coverage. It integrates advanced technology, systematic record-keeping practices, and a network of trained 
personnel to aid health officials in tackling widespread inequities in vaccine distribution. By overcoming challenges 
related to infrastructure, monitoring and management information systems, and human resource constraints—which often lead 
to overstocking and stock-outs in storage facilities—SMILE supports evidence-based public health decisions by providing 
data freely to policymakers and decision-makers.

## Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Alignment

SMILE contributes to multiple Sustainable Development Goals by strengthening national health logistics systems and digital public infrastructure.

Detailed SDG alignment is available here:

## Flow The Platform
This application’s have 4 main flow that support its use of the application for vaccine and medicine logistics. 
This main flow is Planning, Order, Distribution, and Disposal.

### Planning
![Flow of Planning](docs/images/Flow-Planning-SMILE.jpg)
The **Flow of Planning** for medicines, medical devices, and other health supplies through the SMILE system begins at 
the Regency/Municipal Health Office, which **prepares a needs planning that the needs proposed** by Community Health Centers 
and Hospitals. This planning data is then submitted to the Provincial Health Office for review and consolidation. 
After the Provincial Health Office completes its review, the consolidated planning is submitted to the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia.

At the national level, the Ministry of Health conducts a **desk verification** of the planning together with each Provincial Health Office.
This verification includes planning for medicines and logistics using the e-monev system. Once the verification process is completed, 
confirmation is provided, and all planning data is recorded in the SMILE system to ensure accuracy, transparency, and accountability.

### Order
![Flow of Order](docs/images/Flow-Order-SMILE.jpg)
The **Flow of Ordering** medicines, medical devices, and other health supplies through the SMILE system begins at healthcare 
facilities such as Community Health Centers and Hospitals, which submit their **orders through the system**. These orders are
then forwarded to the Regency/Municipal Health Office for further **processing and confirms** the details, including quantity, 
batch number, and expiration date with **allocation order**. Subsequently, the orders are sent to the Provincial Health Office 
for verification and confirms with allocation order. After this step, the Provincial Health Office submits the orders to 
the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia. Once the orders are received, the Ministry of Health confirms and allocation order. 

After confirmation, Order is carried out according to the data recorded in the SMILE system. All ordering and 
distribution data are recorded in the SMILE system to ensure transparency, accuracy, and traceability.

### Distribution
![Flow of Distribution](docs/images/Flow-Distribution-SMILE.jpg)
The **Flow of Distribution** through the SMILE system begins when the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia to a **distribution order** to the 
**manufacturer or distributor**. The manufacturer or distributor then carries out the distribution of medicines, vaccines, and other logistics 
according to the order. Material data from the distribution process is **recorded in the DIN system and integrated with SMILE based on the KFA**.

Once the distribution is initiated, the Provincial Health Office **receives the supplies and records the distribution data** in SMILE. 
After confirmation, the supplies are further distributed to the Regency/Municipal Health Office, which also records the distribution data in SMILE. 
Finally, the supplies reach the Community Health Centers and Hospitals, where confirmation is provided regarding the quantity, 
batch number, and expiration date.

Throughout the process, all distribution data is documented in SMILE to ensure transparency, accuracy, and traceability. Additionally, 
SMILE tracks the amount of logistics and vaccines used, relocated, and those that have expired or been damaged.

### Disposal
![Flow of Disposal](docs/images/Flow-Disposal-SMILE.jpg)
The **Flow of Disposal** begins with the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia issuing a **distribution order to manufacturers and distributors**. 
Upon receiving the order, manufacturers and distributors distribute medicines, vaccines, and other health logistics as instructed, while recording 
material data based on the DIN system, which is integrated into the SMILE system.

Next, the distribution proceeds in stages. First, the items are delivered to the Provincial Health Office, then to the Regency/Municipal Health Office, 
and finally to community health centers and hospitals. At each stage, **distribution data is documented and recorded in the SMILE** system through 
SMILE Distribution Data.

Once the items reach health facilities, **documenting is carried out for medicines, vaccines, and logistics that cannot be used**. The recorded 
information includes quantity, batch number, and expiration date. This data is then entered into the SMILE system to ensure transparency. 
The SMILE system also records items that cannot be used and have been handed over to a third party for disposal.
